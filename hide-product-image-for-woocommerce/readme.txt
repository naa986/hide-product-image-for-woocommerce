This plugin can be useful if you don't have time to individually hide each product image or want to temporarily hide all product images.

Hide Product Image for WooCommerce doesn't simply hide product images from the visitors. It removes the image element from the WooCommerce product page to ensure it is not visible to search engines either. When this plugin is active there is no need to edit each product and remove the product image from it.
